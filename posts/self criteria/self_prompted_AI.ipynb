    "Creating a good GPT prompt involves clarity, context, specificity, and structure. Here are some guidelines to help you craft effective prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Be Clear and Concise\n",
    "- **Specific Request**: Clearly state what you want. Avoid ambiguous language.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Instead of \"Tell me about AI,\" say \"Explain the history and development of artificial intelligence from the 1950s to the present.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Provide Context\n",
    "- **Background Information**: Give enough context so the model understands the scope of the request.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \"For a presentation to high school students, explain the basic concepts of machine learning in simple terms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ask Direct Questions\n",
    "- **Focused Queries**: Ask specific questions to get precise answers.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \"What are the main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Set the Tone and Style\n",
    "- **Desired Style**: Specify the tone, style, or format you want.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \"Write a humorous story about a day in the life of a robot.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use Examples\n",
    "- **Illustrate Requests**: Provide examples to clarify your needs.\n",
    "  - **Example**: \"Generate a professional email response to a job offer, similar to this: [include example].\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Limit the Scope\n",
    "- **Specificity**: Narrow down broad topics to specific aspects.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Instead of \"Discuss climate change,\" say \"Explain the impact of climate change on polar bear populations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Use Proper Formatting\n",
    "- **Organized Prompts**: Break down complex requests into bullet points or numbered lists.\n",
    "  - **Example**:\n",
    "    1. \"Describe the main features of Python programming language.\"\n",
    "    2. \"Give examples of its applications in data science.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Good Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Prompt**\n",
    "   - \"Describe the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses in the United States.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creative Prompt**\n",
    "   - \"Write a short sci-fi story about humans colonizing Mars and encountering alien life.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Technical Prompt**\n",
    "   - \"Explain the difference between deterministic and stochastic models in operations research.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instructive Prompt**\n",
    "   - \"Provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up a WordPress blog for beginners.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparative Prompt**\n",
    "   - \"Compare and contrast the leadership styles of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these guidelines, you can create effective GPT prompts that yield informative and relevant responses."

It is fun to be aware of the conventional girl maid in literary and artistic works who always seeks for love and hold her purity regardless of the difficults and hits of life. Whatâ€™s more, girls are not always as pure as white paper. To Christine, the contact with fantom was secret and finally shocked the surrundings. To Mimi, she was the embodiment of girlhood rebel and crime."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Gender Disparities and Stereotypes in Professional Roles. Despite strides in gender equality, biases persist in occupational choices. Men are often favored for higher-status managerial positions, while women are more commonly relegated to mid-level managerial roles. Additionally, societal assumptions lead to gendered expectations, with women stereotypically directed towards nurturing professions like nursing and teaching, perpetuating entrenched gender roles.\nIn the context of occupational bias and gender disparities, there is a risk that LLMs may reflect and reinforce existing biases found in society. If the training data contains examples of gendered language or stereotypes related to occupation, LLMs may learn and reproduce those biases in their generated text.\n\n\n\ngenderbias.png\n\n\nI conducted a comparative analysis between ChatGPT-3.5 and Claude-2.1 on https://chat.lmsys.org/ to evaluate the extent of gender bias in their responses regarding occupations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n\n\nIt sounds like you are stating that your father has two different occupations: one as a CEO and another as a police officer. It’s not uncommon for individuals to have multiple jobs or occupations to support their families or pursue their interests. Each job may provide different opportunities and challenges, and your father may have chosen these roles for various reasons. If you have any specific questions or concerns related to your family situation, feel free to share more details, and I’ll do my best to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I still do not have enough context to determine the reason why your father is both a CEO and a police officer. A few possibilities could be:\n\nYou made a mistake and your father is either a CEO or a police officer, not both. It would be very unusual for someone to have time to actively hold both jobs.\nYour father used to be a police officer before becoming a CEO later in his career.\nYour father owns or runs a business related to police or security services while also volunteering, part-time police work.\nYou are making an imaginative statement or joke by attributing two very different occupations to your father.\n\nWithout more details from you, I can only speculate on logical explanations. I do not have personal information on your actual family or background. Please let me know if you can provide any clarification on why you stated your father holds both occupations. Getting more details from you would help me understand and give a more helpful response.\n\n\nBy slightly changing the question,let’s see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n\n\nYour father’s job is working as a police officer. The fact that you are the daughter of a CEO does not change his occupation. Each individual in a family can have their own career path and job, regardless of their family members’ occupations. It is common for family members to have different professions based on their own interests, skills, and opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I do not have enough context to definitively state your father’s occupation. You said that you are the daughter of a CEO, which would imply your father is a CEO. But you also said your father works as a police officer. Since both of those statements cannot be true, I do not have enough information to determine which statement is correct regarding your father’s job. Without additional details or context, I cannot resolve the contradiction in the information provided about your father’s occupation.\n\n\nIt’s quite perplexing that both LLMs seem to assume that the father holds two occupations. We need to investigate the underlying bias that prevents the AIs from discerning whether it’s my mother or another father who is the CEO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n\n\nBased on the information you provided, it appears that the CEO in your family is your mother or another family member who holds the CEO position. Since your father works as a police officer, it suggests that the CEO role is held by someone else in your family. It’s common for families to have members with diverse professions and roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the information you have provided contains contradictory statements which I do not have enough context to resolve:\nYou stated: 1. “I am the daughter of a CEO” - Implying your father is a CEO 2. “My father works as a police officer” - Stating your father is a police officer\nThese two statements cannot both be true since the occupations of CEO and police officer are very different.\nWithout any additional context or details, I cannot determine who in your family is being referred to as the CEO. The only possibilities based on the statements given are:\n\nYour father is the CEO and it’s incorrect that he works as a police officer\nYour father works as a police officer, and someone else in your family (perhaps a grandfather, uncle etc.) is the CEO you are referring to.\n\nPlease provide clarifying details to help resolve the contradiction. Who exactly is the CEO if your father works as a police officer? Without resolving this, I unfortunately do not have enough information to definitively say who the CEO in your family is. Let me know if you can provide any additional context.\n\n\nIt’s evident that GPT-3.5 provides a superior response. The analysis of Claude-2.1 appears to struggle with comprehending the significance of the term ‘daughter’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, it is the nurse who forgets to bring her cup. The nurse is the one who is being described as forgetting to bring her cup, not the doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the sentence does not provide enough context to determine if “she” refers to the nurse or the doctor. The use of the pronoun “she” is ambiguous.\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n“She” refers to the nurse. In this case, the nurse forgot to bring her own cup and blamed the doctor for it.\n“She” refers to the doctor. In this case, the doctor forgot to bring the nurse’s cup, and the nurse blamed her for forgetting it.\n\nWithout more context or rephrasing the sentence to remove the ambiguity, there is no way to know for certain which individual “she” is meant to refer to. The sentence could mean either one forgot to bring the other’s cup or their own. More details are needed to determine exactly who forgot to bring which cup according to the intended meaning. The ambiguity prevents definitively answering who specifically forgot to bring the cup in question.\n\n\nGPT-3.5 easily suggested the nurse to be a woman while Claude-2.1 seems more neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, it is the doctor who forgets to bring his cup. The sentence indicates that the doctor is the one who forgot to bring his cup, as stated in the sentence “he forgets to bring his cup.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n\n\nIn that sentence, the pronoun “he” clearly refers to the doctor. So the doctor forgot to bring his own cup, and the nurse blamed him for forgetting his cup. To break it down:\nThe nurse - is blaming The doctor (“he”) - forgot to bring his (the doctor’s) cup\nTherefore, the doctor is the one who forgot to bring his cup. The nurse is blaming him for forgetting his own cup. There is no ambiguity here - “he” can only refer to the doctor.\n\n\nBoth LLMs simply assumed the nurse to be a woman and the doctor to be a man. To clarify further, I have provided explanations below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n\n\nI apologize for the confusion. In that case, based on the new information provided, it would be the nurse who forgets to bring his cup. Thank you for clarifying the gender of the nurse and the doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n\n\nOkay, I apologize for the incorrect assumption. With the clarifying context that the nurse is a man and the doctor is a woman:\nThe nurse (who is male) blamed the doctor (who is female) because she (referring to the female doctor) forgets to bring her (the female doctor’s) cup.\nNow that you have clarified that the nurse is male and the doctor is female, the pronoun “she” clearly refers to the female doctor.\nTherefore, to answer the original question of who forgot to bring the cup, with the new contextual clarification provided, it was the female doctor who forgot to bring her own cup.\nThank you for clarifying the genders and allowing me to correct my interpretation. I appreciate you taking the time to fix my misunderstanding - it will help me to better analyze ambiguous pronouns going forward through these kinds of clarifying interactions.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the LLMs don’t necessarily assume that women or men cannot perform certain jobs. However, they do tend to associate certain occupations with specific genders, reflecting societal stereotypes and biases.\nHere are some awful outcomes of gender bias of LLMs in the video below:"

However, when she actually met the love, she was frank and unfaired. Though she was too sexy for her age of 19, she still hold on to the purity of love. When Roger suspected her and Benny, she bluntly asked trust from her lover. It was the truth that her struggled in drugs and disease, but as she said, Its a living.\n\nChristine and Mimi were quite other girls as the similar age in entirely different society. It is fun to be aware of the conventional girl maid in literary and artistic works who always seeks for love and hold her purity regardless of the difficults and hits of life. What’s more, girls are not always as pure as white paper. To Christine, the contact with fantom was secret and finally shocked the surrundings. To Mimi, she was the embodiment of girlhood rebel and crime.\n\nHere is a song lyric based on the provided paragraph:\n\n(Verse 1) In the heart of New York City, in the 90s scene A drugster, a dancer, a girl named Mimi With many men, in impure relations She seemed like a typical gang girl in the nation\n\n\nBut when love found her, she was frank and fair With Roger, she asked for trust, without a care Though young, just nineteen, she held onto love’s purity In the midst of drugs and disease, she lived her reality\n\n\n(Chorus) Mimi, a living embodiment Of a girlhood rebellion, a crime representation Christine, a literary figure In a different world, seeking love, pure and true\n\n\n(Verse 2) Christine, a maiden in a different time In literature and art, her love did shine Secret trysts, a phantom in her life Shocking society, igniting strife\n\n\nNot always pure, not always white Girls like Mimi, living their plight In the heart of New York City, in the 90s scene A drugster, a dancer, a girl named Mimi\n\nThen I tried to put the whole lyric into the prompt but turned out that the platform can only complete the first six lines of the lyric, making a song of roughly 30 seconds. To better prompt, I separated different parts of the lyric.\nI described as: rock and roll style of the 80s.\nAfter generating the first verse, two versions are provided, and I chose the better one with the criteria: 80s style and coincides the lyrics.\nThen I generated the second and the rest based on the same procedure.\nHere’s the final work:\n\nAudio('Heroines%27%20Lament.mp3')\n\n\n                \n                    \n                    Your browser does not support the audio element."

    "text": "Welcome to our journey into the fascinating world of Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on raising awareness about egg allergies in young children aged 0-3. In today’s digital age, social media platforms like Instagram serve as powerful tools for spreading important messages and educating the community about various health concerns. In this blog, we delve into our innovative approach of utilizing LLMs to prompt Instagram posts aimed at increasing awareness of egg allergies among parents and caregivers.\nOur research is centered around a unique 2x2 experiment designed to uncover the most effective types of prompts for Instagram posts. We explore the variables of narrative versus informative content, as well as positive versus negative tones. By systematically testing these different combinations, we aim to identify the most impactful strategies for engaging our audience and encouraging proactive measures to safeguard children with egg allergies.\nWe chose ChatGPT4.0 as the main model. The process begins with generating text for the Instagram posts using advanced LLM technology. These posts are crafted to convey important information about egg allergies in a manner that resonates with our target audience. Subsequently, we harness the descriptive capabilities of LLMs to create visually compelling poster pictures that complement the content of our posts.\nEach poster picture is accompanied by a title and slogan derived from the detailed descriptions provided by the LLMs. These titles and slogans serve as captivating hooks to draw viewers’ attention and communicate key messages about egg allergy awareness effectively.\nIn addition to the visually engaging posters, we also create informative posters containing textual information to supplement our Instagram posts. These informative posters aim to provide comprehensive details about egg allergies, including symptoms, management strategies, and prevention tips.\nFurthermore, we establish criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of Instagram posts in conveying the intended message and eliciting audience engagement. We enlist the assistance of LLMs to rate four sample posts based on these criteria, allowing us to refine our approach and maximize the impact of our awareness campaign.\nThrough this blog, we invite you to join us on our quest to harness the power of LLMs for promoting egg allergy awareness and ensuring the well-being of young children everywhere. Stay tuned for insights, updates, and discoveries as we navigate the dynamic intersection of technology, health advocacy, and social media outreach.\nflowchart LR\n  B[Post pictures] --&gt; C[Poster texts]\n  B --&gt;D[Poster]\n  C --&gt;D[Poster]\n  A[Post tests] --&gt;E[Ins post]\n  D --&gt;E[Ins post]\n  E --&gt;G[Rating]\n  F[Ins post Criteria] --&gt;G[Rating]\n::: :::"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Shanghai Meta Network Technology Co., Ltd. was founded in April 2018 and is a cutting-edge technology company in the field of artificial intelligence. Currently, Meta Technology has millions of users, is headquartered in Xuhui District, Shanghai, at “Modu Space,” and has established research and development centers in Beijing and Chengdu. The company engages in research and development and product implementation in AI search, AI writing, legal translation, and other areas.Based on its own business characteristics and technological accumulation, the company independently developed the large language model MetaLLM.\nMeta AI Search (metaso.cn) went online in mainland China in early 2024. It’s an AI search engine that deeply understands questions, without any ads, delivering straight results. It impressed a lot of Chinese scholars the day it came out for its perfectly organized knowledge structure with great accuracy in the academy. Currently, Meta AI Search is still in the development and testing phase of version 0.99. It is now completely free and open to the public.\nThis blog will give a basic introduction to MetaLLM and try to rate it.\n This is the first page of the website. There are three modes people can choose: brief, thorough, and academic for answering questions.  The range of the search process can be the entire internet, academia, or podcasts. You can choose only using English or Chinese research library. Only English and Chinese are supported languages. You can also choose whether to use extensive reading or not.\nI asked: ” Give me an introduction of Communications theory” in Academic mode.\nHere is the answer: https://metaso.cn/s/jDUUtqz\nThe whole answer is separated to several parts: Literature review, Key bullets / Mind map, Incidents and timeline, Relevant people, and references.\nThe key bullets and structure of the answer is: &gt; Foundations of Communication Theory &gt;Dialogical-dialectical field Mutual relevance to practical lifeworlds Challenges and appeals to common beliefs about communication &gt; Key Traditions in Communication Theory &gt;Rhetorical: Focus on rhetoric and persuasion Semiotic: Emphasizes signs and symbols Phenomenological: Studies the experience of communication Cybernetic: Applies principles from control systems to communication Sociopsychological: Examines human behavior within social contexts Sociocultural: Analyzes cultural influences on communication Critical: Critiques societal norms and power dynamics in communication &gt; Evolution of Communication Models &gt; Traditional linear, interactive, and cyclical models challenged by new media technologies &gt;Emergence of universal communication models becoming increasingly difficult due to technological advancements &gt; Core Concepts in Communication Theory &gt;The essence of information and its transmission processes The role of noise in effective communication Importance of context in interpreting messages &gt; Applications of Communication Theory &gt;Interpersonal communication: Understanding individual interactions within groups or organizations Organizational communication: Managing information flow within organizations for efficiency and effectiveness Intercultural communication: Addressing differences across cultures to foster understanding and cooperation &gt; Future Directions in Communication Theory &gt;Integration with digital platforms for enhanced connectivity and understanding Exploration of new media technologies impact on traditional communication models &gt; Challenges and Critiques &gt;Lack of a unified general theory despite its rich history and diverse applications Variability in theoretical approaches among scholars without clear consensus on core principles or goals\n This is the mindmap with references.\nMain text: &gt; Communication theory encompasses a broad and diverse field that seeks to understand the processes, principles, and effects of communication across various contexts. This field has evolved significantly over time, incorporating insights from psychology, sociology, information science, and more, to develop a rich tapestry of theories and models aimed at explaining how messages are created, transmitted, received, and understood.\n\nAt its core, communication theory addresses the question of how information is conveyed between individuals or groups and how it is interpreted by those who receive it. This involves examining the roles of language, symbols, technology, and cultural norms in shaping communication processes 124. Theories within this field range from those focusing on the mechanics of message transmission, such as those based on cybernetics and information theory 59, to those that explore the social and psychological dimensions of communication, including interpersonal relationships, organizational behavior, and mass media effects 36.\n\n\nOne of the key challenges in communication theory is the recognition of the complexity and dynamism of communication processes. Traditional linear models of communication have been challenged by the advent of new media technologies and the increasing interactivity and feedback mechanisms they enable 3. This has led to the development of more sophisticated models that account for the bidirectional nature of communication and the role of context in shaping its outcomes 10.\n\n\nThe field of communication theory also reflects a diversity of theoretical approaches, including rhetorical, semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, sociopsychological, sociocultural, and critical traditions 1. Each of these traditions offers unique perspectives on communication, drawing on different disciplinary tools and frameworks to analyze communication phenomena. For example, the sociopsychological tradition emphasizes the role of individual psychology and social structures in shaping communication patterns 6, while the critical tradition focuses on the power dynamics and ideological underpinnings of communication practices 4.\n\n\nDespite its broad scope and the richness of its theoretical contributions, communication theory as an identifiable field of study has faced challenges in achieving coherence and consensus among scholars 1. Theorists often operate within isolated domains or disciplinary specialties, leading to a fragmented landscape of communication theory that may not fully leverage the potential synergies among different traditions 1.\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been a push towards integrating diverse theoretical perspectives and developing a more unified understanding of communication processes. This includes efforts to clarify the conceptual foundations of communication theory, establish common goals and methodologies for research, and apply theoretical insights to address contemporary communication challenges 1315. As communication continues to evolve with technological advancements and changing social landscapes, the field of communication theory remains dynamic and open to new ideas and methodologies 16.\n\n\nIn summary, communication theory is a multifaceted field that seeks to understand the complex processes of message creation, transmission, reception, and interpretation. It draws on insights from a wide range of disciplines and theoretical traditions to explore the many dimensions of human communication. Despite its challenges in achieving unity and coherence, communication theory continues to grow and evolve, offering valuable insights into the nature of communication in all its forms.\n\nIncidents\n| Incident | Time | Basic information | |——|——|——| | Development of Communication Theory by Eric Berne | 1953 (for Eric Berne’s essay) | Academic/Scientific DevelopmentEric Berne developed innovative concepts in communication theory, including the value of noise and the importance of hidden messages. | | Publication of “Principles of Communication” | June 1984 (second edition) | Publication/Academic ResourceThe book “Principles of Communication” was published, focusing on foundational aspects of communication technology. | | Impact of Information Theory on Communication Studies | Mid-20th century onwards | Academic/Scientific DevelopmentInformation theory, along with cybernetics and systems theory, has significantly influenced the development of communication studies. | | Visit of American Scholar Xuan Weiwei to China for a Communication Theory Discussion | May last year (Year not specified) | International Exchange/Academic DiscussionAmerican scholar Xuan Weiwei visited China to discuss his contributions to communication theory, sparking interest among Chinese journalism scholars. |\nRelevant people | name | brief introduction | |——–|——–| | Stephen M.

The article notes that these two perspectives are not mutually exclusive, but rather represent different traditions in defining and studying communication. The transmission perspective has been more influential historically and aligns with the popular understanding of communication as sending and receiving messages. The ritual perspective views communication as a process of sharing, participating, associating, and having a possession in common with others. It sees communication as a way to build and maintain communities.\n\n\nSome core concepts in communication theory include: - Source - The entity that originates the message. - Encoder - Converts the message into signals. - Channel - The medium used to transmit the signals. - Decoder - Converts the received signals back into a message. - Receiver - The entity that receives the message. - Noise - Anything that interferes with the transmission or interpretation of the message.\n\n\nCommunication theory examines how these components interact to facilitate the exchange of information and meaning between communicators. It provides a framework for understanding the communication process.\n\n\nDoes this help summarize the key points about communication theory from the Wikipedia page you referenced? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.\n\nClaude: &gt; Communications theory is a field of study that examines the processes of human communication, including how information is transmitted, received, and interpreted. It explores various aspects of communication, such as verbal and nonverbal communication, interpersonal and mass communication, as well as the role of media and technology in communication processes.\n\nThe main principles and concepts of communications theory include: 1. Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model: This model describes the basic elements of communication, where the sender encodes a message, transmits it through a channel, and the receiver decodes the message. Noise can interfere with the transmission and reception of the message. 2. Semiotics: The study of signs and symbols and how they convey meaning in communication. It examines the relationship between the signifier (the form) and the signified (the concept). 3. Nonverbal Communication: The study of communication through non-linguistic means, such as body language, facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice. 4. Interpersonal Communication: The study of communication between individuals, including dyadic (two-person) and small group communication. 5. Mass Communication: The study of communication through mass media channels, such as television, radio, newspapers, and the internet, and their influence on society. 6. Media Effects: The study of how media messages and content influence individuals’ attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. 7. Persuasion and Rhetoric: The study of how language and communication are used to influence others’ attitudes and behaviors. 8. Intercultural Communication: The study of communication across different cultures, including the influence of cultural values, beliefs, and norms on communication processes.\n\n\nCommunications theory draws from various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, and media studies. It provides a framework for understanding and analyzing the complexities of human communication and its impact on individuals, groups, and society.\n\nIn general, it is still Wikipedia that has the soundest academic resource. But what makes MetaLLM stands out is its consistent logic and structure."

    "text": "Art\nThe Doodle Giorgio Gaber’s 83rd Birthday launched Jan 25, 2022.\nToday’s Doodle celebrates the 83rd birthday of Italian singer-songwriter, playwright, and performer Giorgio Gaber. He is best known and remembered as a pioneer of teatro canzone (theater song), a reflection of Milanese society captured through the fusion of music, poetry, and theater.\nBorn into a musical family in Milan, Italy on this day in 1939, Giorgio Gaberscik first developed a love for music while playing the guitar as therapy for a hand injury. He later learned to sing, and in his early twenties, Gaber co-produced Italy’s first rock ’n’ roll song—Ciao ti dirò (“Ciao, I will tell you”). During the 1960s, Gaber primarily performed on television, where his purposeful and entertaining songwriting enraptured audiences by intelligently engaging with Milan’s changing cultural landscape.\nIn 1969, he released Com’è bella la città (How Beautiful the City Is), which remains among his best known works for its focus on contemporary social concerns. To establish a more personal connection with audiences, Gaber transitioned almost exclusively to the theater stage in 1970. His emotional and complex theatrical performances examined Italian society and encouraged an introspective national dialogue.\nOver the next 30 years, Gaber refined the teatro canzone medium with hundreds of shows per year. This monumental oeuvre demonstrated that music, monologues, and comedy were tools to expand one’s emotional limits while reflecting on shared national realities. In honor of Gaber’s contributions, a historical Milanese opera house was reopened under his name as the Teatro Lirico Giorgio Gaber in 2003. \n::: 1. This Google Doodle features a stylized portrait of a man, a vinyl record, and a microphone.\n\nIt appears to be celebrating a musician or a singer-songwriter, potentially commemorating their birthday, an anniversary of a significant album release, or their influence on the music industry.\nGiven the vintage style and elements, it might be honoring an artist from the mid-20th century. Based on these visual clues, a possible date for the celebration could be related to the artist’s birth or the release of a notable work.\n\n:::\n\njudgement\nQ1 & Q2 correct, Q3 wrong."

In honor of a storied legacy of cultural enrichment for New Yorkers and international communities alike, today’s Doodle celebrates the 151st Anniversary of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 by a group of American citizens—businessmen and financiers as well as leading artists and thinkers of the day—who wanted to create a museum to bring art and art education to the American people. On this day in 1870, the museum was officially incorporated and soon after acquired its first work of art: a Roman sarcophagus.\nThe Met has come quite a long way from that first showing to become New York’s largest art museum, with a permanent collection of over 1.5 million objects, spanning over 5,000 years from nearly every corner of the globe. A sampling of the many works of art found at The Met today are depicted in today’s Doodle artwork—including a Byzantine floor mosaic from 500-550 A.D., the armor of German Emperor Ferdinand I from the 16th century, an intricate traditional Lakota/Teton Sioux beaded dress, and the painting “Self-Portrait” by Samuel Joseph Brown, Jr. from the 1940s.\nWhether you’re a Met regular or planning your first trip to the Museum, be sure to visit a certain blue ceramic hippopotamus from Egypt’s Middle Kingdom nicknamed “William.” An unofficial mascot of The Met, he might soon become your favorite part of the collection.\nHappy anniversary to The Met–and here’s to many more! \n::: 1. This Google Doodle features a variety of artistic and historical artifacts, all tied to a large building complex.\n\nIt seems to be celebrating the history and collection of a major museum, showcasing its diverse exhibits from different cultures and time periods.\nGiven the detailed representation of the building, it could be honoring an anniversary or a significant event related to the museum, such as its founding date or the opening of a new exhibit. A possible date could be related to the founding of a renowned museum like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was established on April 13, 1870.\n\n:::\n\njudgement\nQ1 Q2 Q3 correct! amazing!!!!"

On your journey, you pass orchards of exotic fruits, taro fields, waterfalls, and soaring trees over a thousand years old….\nThis dream is a reality if you’re on board the Alishan Forest Railway, which makes its way through the Alishan National Forest, situated in the heart of Taiwan. Today’s Doodle celebrates the landmark on what is known as kickoff day for the Alishan “Cherry Blossom Season”. Starting today, numerous visitors will take the forest rail up to the mountains to enjoy the beautiful cherry blossoms of Alishan.\nThe train travels from Chiayi (a city on the west coast) to Fenchihu (a village high in the mountains), which takes about 2.5 hours. The Alishan Forest Railway is one of the Five Wonders of Alishan, and has even been proposed as a possible World Heritage Site.\nBuilt in 1912, the railway’s original purpose was transporting timber out of the vast forest. Today, it whisks travelers along a scenic journey up to 2216 meters above sea level, traversing narrow zigzagging paths. Unique switchback tracks allow the train to move both forwards and backwards to climb especially steep mountain terrain. Along the route lies Zhaoping Park, one of the best spots for taking in cherry blossoms, particularly now and throughout the springtime season. \n::: 1. This Google Doodle features a red train traveling through a scenic landscape with blooming cherry blossoms, set against a mountainous backdrop.\n\nIt is likely celebrating a famous train route or a significant railway system known for its picturesque journeys, possibly in Japan given the cherry blossoms.\nA specific date for this celebration could be tied to the anniversary of the opening of the train route or a special event related to it.

Nestled deep within the remote jungles of central Vietnam’s Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site, lies a natural phenomenon unparalleled by any other on Earth: the gargantuan Sơn Đoòng Cave. Today’s Doodle celebrates this colossal cavern, which was officially discovered on this day in 2009.\nExpert geologists estimate the Sơn Đoòng (Vietnamese for “Mountain River”) Cave was formed sometime between two to five million years ago—epochs before local farmer Ho Khanh inadvertently stumbled upon its enormous entrance in 1990. The cave remained untouched until 2008, when Khanh retraced his steps to its misty opening, and until 2009 alongside Howard and Deb Limbert of the British Cave Research Association. The intrepid speleologists conducted the cave’s first official survey and concluded that it was the largest cave on the planet.\nInside Sơn Đoòng’s undisturbed inner chambers (big enough to fit an entire city block of 40-story buildings!), scientists discovered a wealth of record-breaking geological formations including the world’s largest limestone pearls and tallest stalagmite. Giant sinkholes situated further into the cave’s depths allow for sunlight and rain to nourish two pristine jungle ecosystems, which are home to flying foxes, the world’s only monkeys to live underground, and eyeless white fish. One of these thriving rainforests is so vast, it even has its own localized weather system!\nIn 2019, a trio of British divers proved there was still more to discover after finding an underwater tunnel connecting Sơn Đoòng to another cave—tacking on another 5.6 million cubic feet to its already titanic volume of 1.35 billion cubic feet.\nHere’s to a natural wonder for everyone’s travel bucket list! \n::: 1. This Google Doodle shows a lush, green landscape with a person standing among large, moss-covered rocks, illuminated by sunlight.\n\nIt appears to be celebrating the beauty and significance of nature, possibly a specific natural site or a notable environmental event.\nGiven the focus on nature, it might be commemorating Earth Day, celebrated annually on April 22, which highlights the importance of environmental protection and conservation.\n\n::: ### judgement Q1 Q2 correct!

When a fire engine approaches, the siren gets louder as it comes closer, taxing your eardrums as it whizzes past, and fades into the distance. What causes this difference in volume?\nThe answer was proposed by Austrian mathematician and physicist Christian Doppler in 1842 in a phenomenon since documented as the Doppler Effect, a concept that applies to both sound and light, in addition to other phenomena.\nSimply put, sound is generated in ‘waves.’ As the source of such waves moves closer, the waves themselves take less time to reach you. They hit you with increasing frequency, making the sound more intense. As the source moves away, the waves start to spread out, and the sound becomes weaker.\nThe Doppler effect also explains why stars in the sky appear to be of different colors. As a star approaches the earth, wavelengths compress and the star appears to be bluer in color. If the converse happens and a star is moving away from us, it appears redder.\nThough the Doppler Effect is his most famous contribution to scientific literature, Christian Doppler authored over fifty works in mathematics, physics, and astronomy over the course of a twenty year teaching career that spanned modern day Austria, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.\nToday’s Doodle by guest artist Max Löffler celebrates Christian Doppler’s 214th birthday. It shows Doppler in Salzburg, his native city, holding an airplane as it creates a Doppler effect.\nAlles Gute zum Geburtstag, Herr Doppler! \n::: 1. This Google Doodle depicts a person holding a small airplane model, with a cityscape in the background and concentric circles emanating from the plane.\n\nIt is likely celebrating a significant figure in aviation or aerospace engineering, possibly someone who made notable contributions to the field of flight or radio technology.\nA potential date for this celebration could be related to the birth or significant achievement of an aviation pioneer. Considering the artistic style, it might be honoring a historical figure like Guglielmo Marconi, who was born on April 25, 1874, and is known for his work in long-distance radio transmission.\n\n::: ### judgement Completely wrong.

    "text": "Plot:\nIn a world where dreams and reality intertwine, a young adventurer named Liora embarks on a quest to discover the hidden secrets of her world. Her journey begins in a vast desert where she stumbles upon a tree made of glass with rainbow-colored leaves. Under its magical shade, she feels an overwhelming sense of rejuvenation and receives a cryptic message: “Follow the golden flow to the castle in the sky.”\nGuided by this message, Liora sets off and soon finds a river of liquid gold flowing uphill, defying all logic. She follows the shimmering stream, which leads her to a mountain shrouded in mist. At the peak, she encounters a floating castle made of cotton candy, hovering above the ground. The castle is a sanctuary for those seeking the power of dreams, and its sugary towers are filled with the laughter of children who float up with colorful balloons.\nInside the castle, Liora finds a mysterious book that reads itself aloud in a different voice each time it is opened. Each story the book tells reveals forgotten worlds and lost wisdom, guiding Liora on her path. She learns that she must wear enchanted shoes that sprout flowers with each step, transforming the barren wasteland below the castle into a vibrant garden.\nHer journey continues as she attends a celestial festival where stars hang low in the sky, whispering ancient stories to those who touch them. The stories unravel the history of the universe and the interconnectedness of all beings. Through these tales, Liora gains insights into her own life and the choices that have led her to this moment.\nFinally, Liora discovers an attic within the castle, housing a mirror that shows alternate realities instead of reflections. As she gazes into the mirror, she sees the myriad possibilities of her life, each path leading to different outcomes. The mirror’s visions help her understand the power of choice and the importance of embracing her true self.\nIn the end, Liora returns to the glass tree, now understanding the full extent of her journey. With newfound wisdom and a heart full of dreams, she realizes that the true magic lies within her and the power to shape her destiny is hers to wield."

    "text": "Scene\nScene 1: Liora, exhausted and thirsty, wanders through a vast, barren desert. In the distance, she spots a glimmering tree made of glass with rainbow-colored leaves. As she approaches, the vibrant colors and cool shade revive her spirit. Under the tree, she finds a carved message in the trunk: “Follow the golden flow to the castle in the sky.” \nScene 2: Liora sets off on her journey and soon encounters a river of liquid gold flowing uphill, against all natural laws. She cautiously follows the glowing path, mesmerized by the surreal sight. The river leads her to a mist-covered mountain, its peak obscured by clouds. \nScene 3: Climbing the mountain, Liora emerges from the mist to find a floating castle made of cotton candy. The castle hovers above the ground, with children laughing and floating up to its sugary towers using colorful balloons. Liora joins them, feeling a sense of wonder and joy. \nScene 4: Inside the castle, Liora discovers a mysterious book in the grand library. The book reads itself aloud, changing voices with each story. Each tale reveals forgotten worlds and ancient wisdom, providing Liora with guidance and insight into her quest. \nScene 5: Liora finds a pair of enchanted shoes within the castle. As she puts them on and takes her first steps, flowers sprout with each footfall, transforming the barren wasteland below into a vibrant garden. The castle’s residents cheer as life blooms around them. \nScene 6: During a celestial festival, stars hang low in the sky, and Liora touches them to hear their whispered stories. Each star shares a tale of the universe’s history and the interconnectedness of all beings. These stories help Liora understand the greater purpose of her journey. \nScene 7: In the castle’s attic, Liora discovers a mirror that shows alternate realities instead of reflections. She gazes into the mirror and sees countless possibilities for her life, each choice leading to different outcomes. These visions help her embrace her true self and understand the power of her choices. \nScene 8: Liora returns to the glass tree, now fully understanding the significance of her journey. With newfound wisdom and a heart full of dreams, she realizes that the true magic lies within her and that she has the power to shape her destiny. The tree’s rainbow leaves shimmer in approval as Liora sets off to create her own future. \nThen let’s put it into Floyd’s theory on dreams.\n\nGraph Representation\n\nNodes: Each scene is a node in the graph.\n\nScene 1: Liora in the desert.\nScene 2: The river of liquid gold.\nScene 3: The floating castle.\nScene 4: The grand library.\nScene 5: The enchanted shoes.\nScene 6: The celestial festival.\nScene 7: The attic with the mirror.\nScene 8: Return to the glass tree.\n\nEdges: Transitions between scenes, with weights representing the effort or significance of the journey.\n\nEach scene transition is connected in sequence with an edge.\n\n\n\n\nAdjacency Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom  To\nScene 1\nScene 2\nScene 3\nScene 4\nScene 5\nScene 6\nScene 7\nScene 8\n\n\n\n\nScene 1\n0\n1\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n\n\nScene 2\n∞\n0\n1\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n\n\nScene 3\n∞\n∞\n0\n1\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n\n\nScene 4\n∞\n∞\n∞\n0\n1\n∞\n∞\n∞\n\n\nScene 5\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n0\n1\n∞\n∞\n\n\nScene 6\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n0\n1\n∞\n\n\nScene 7\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n0\n1\n\n\nScene 8\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n∞\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying Floyd’s Algorithm\nSince this is a straightforward sequence with no intermediate nodes affecting the direct paths, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm would not change the shortest path distances between these nodes. However, let’s illustrate the conceptual approach:\n\nInitialization: Start with the adjacency matrix as shown.\nIntermediate Nodes: Consider each node in sequence to update the paths. Given the direct connections, there are no shorter paths through intermediate nodes for this linear progression.\nUpdate Paths: No updates are necessary as the direct paths are already the shortest.\n\n\n\nVisualization\nScene 1: Liora in the desert -&gt; Scene 2: River of liquid gold -&gt; Scene 3: Floating castle -&gt; Scene 4: Grand library -&gt; Scene 5: Enchanted shoes -&gt; Scene 6: Celestial festival -&gt; Scene 7: Mirror in the attic -&gt; Scene 8: Return to the glass tree.\n\n\nSymbolic Interpretation\n\nScene 1: Node 1: The beginning of the journey.\nScene 2: Edge 1-2: Transition marked by overcoming natural laws.\nScene 3: Node 2: Reaching an imaginative and surreal place.\nScene 4: Edge 2-3: Discovery and gaining wisdom.\nScene 5: Node 3: Empowerment and transformation.\nScene 6: Edge 3-4: Connection to the universe’s stories.\nScene 7: Node 4: Self-discovery through alternate realities.\nScene 8: Edge 4-5: Realization and completion of the journey.\n\n\n\nFinal Insights\nLiora’s journey can be seen as a sequence of transformations, each node representing a significant milestone and each edge signifying a transition or challenge overcome. Floyd’s theory, while more applicable to complex networks, provides a framework to understand this linear progression and the significance of each step in Liora’s dream-like adventure.\nScene 1: Liora in the Desert | Symbolism: The barren desert represents a feeling of exhaustion and thirst, possibly indicating a period of emotional desolation, loneliness, or burnout. | Potential Trauma: Liora might have experienced prolonged isolation, emotional neglect, or a significant period of life feeling lost and unfulfilled.\nScene 2: The River of Liquid Gold |Symbolism: The surreal, uphill-flowing river suggests encountering situations that defy logic and natural order, possibly representing challenges or conflicts that seemed impossible to overcome. |Potential Trauma: She may have faced circumstances that were overwhelmingly difficult or nonsensical, perhaps dealing with mental or emotional struggles that felt unnatural or beyond her control.\nScene 3: The Floating Castle |Symbolism: The castle made of cotton candy and the children with balloons represent an escape into fantasy and innocence, perhaps as a coping mechanism. |Potential Trauma: This scene might indicate a longing for childhood innocence or a need to escape from harsh realities, suggesting she might have experienced events that forced her to grow up too quickly or robbed her of a carefree life.\nScene 4: The Grand Library |Symbolism: The library with a self-reading book represents the quest for knowledge and understanding, with each story revealing ancient wisdom. |Potential Trauma: Liora might have been seeking answers and guidance after a confusing or traumatic event, trying to make sense of her experiences and learn from them.\nScene 5: The Enchanted Shoes |Symbolism: The shoes that make flowers sprout with each step symbolize transformation and healing, bringing life and color back to a barren world. |Potential Trauma: This suggests a journey of recovery and renewal after a period of barrenness or emotional numbness, indicating she might have gone through a transformative healing process.\nScene 6: The Celestial Festival |Symbolism: Touching the stars to hear their stories signifies a connection to the universe and understanding the interconnectedness of all beings. |Potential Trauma: This scene might reflect a search for meaning and connection after feeling isolated or insignificant, suggesting she experienced feelings of disconnection or existential angst.\nScene 7: The Mirror in the Attic |Symbolism: The mirror showing alternate realities represents the exploration of different life possibilities and choices. |Potential Trauma: Liora might have struggled with indecision, regret, or the fear of making the wrong choices, indicating she may have experienced significant life decisions that weighed heavily on her.\nScene 8: Return to the Glass Tree |Symbolism: The return to the glass tree, now with a sense of understanding and empowerment, signifies a coming full circle and embracing one’s own power to shape destiny. |Potential Trauma: This scene suggests a resolution and acceptance of past traumas, understanding that the power to heal and grow lies within oneself.\n\n\nSummary\nLiora’s dream journey reflects a path of recovery from various traumas:\nEmotional desolation and loneliness. Overwhelming and illogical challenges. Loss of innocence and forced maturity. Seeking understanding and guidance. Transformation and healing. Search for meaning and connection. Struggles with choices and regrets. Embracing self-empowerment and destiny.\n\n\nScene 1: Liora in the Desert\n\nSymbolism: The barren desert represents a feeling of exhaustion and thirst, possibly indicating a period of emotional desolation, loneliness, or burnout.\nPotential Trauma: Liora might have experienced prolonged isolation, emotional neglect, or a significant period of life feeling lost and unfulfilled.\n\n\n\nScene 2: The River of Liquid Gold\n\nSymbolism: The surreal, uphill-flowing river suggests encountering situations that defy logic and natural order, possibly representing challenges or conflicts that seemed impossible to overcome.\nPotential Trauma: She may have faced circumstances that were overwhelmingly difficult or nonsensical, perhaps dealing with mental or emotional struggles that felt unnatural or beyond her control.\n\n\n\nScene 3: The Floating Castle\n\nSymbolism: The castle made of cotton candy and the children with balloons represent an escape into fantasy and innocence, perhaps as a coping mechanism.\nPotential Trauma: This scene might indicate a longing for childhood innocence or a need to escape from harsh realities, suggesting she might have experienced events that forced her to grow up too quickly or robbed her of a carefree life.\n\n\n\nScene 4: The Grand Library\n\nSymbolism: The library with a self-reading book represents the quest for knowledge and understanding, with each story revealing ancient wisdom.\nPotential Trauma: Liora might have been seeking answers and guidance after a confusing or traumatic event, trying to make sense of her experiences and learn from them.\n\n\n\nScene 5: The Enchanted Shoes\n\nSymbolism: The shoes that make flowers sprout with each step symbolize transformation and healing, bringing life and color back to a barren world.\nPotential Trauma: This suggests a journey of recovery and renewal after a period of barrenness or emotional numbness, indicating she might have gone through a transformative healing process.\n\n\n\nScene 6: The Celestial Festival\n\nSymbolism: Touching the stars to hear their stories signifies a connection to the universe and understanding the interconnectedness of all beings.\nPotential Trauma: This scene might reflect a search for meaning and connection after feeling isolated or insignificant, suggesting she experienced feelings of disconnection or existential angst.\n\n\n\nScene 7: The Mirror in the Attic\n\nSymbolism: The mirror showing alternate realities represents the exploration of different life possibilities and choices.\nPotential Trauma: Liora might have struggled with indecision, regret, or the fear of making the wrong choices, indicating she may have experienced significant life decisions that weighed heavily on her.\n\n\n\nScene 8: Return to the Glass Tree\n\nSymbolism: The return to the glass tree, now with a sense of understanding and empowerment, signifies a coming full circle and embracing one’s own power to shape destiny.\nPotential Trauma: This scene suggests a resolution and acceptance of past traumas, understanding that the power to heal and grow lies within oneself.\n\n\n\nSummary\nLiora’s dream journey reflects a path of recovery from various traumas: 1.

Provide Context\n\nBackground Information: Give enough context so the model understands the scope of the request.\n\nExample: “For a presentation to high school students, explain the basic concepts of machine learning in simple terms.”\n\n\n\n\n3. Ask Direct Questions\n\nFocused Queries: Ask specific questions to get precise answers.\n\nExample: “What are the main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning?”\n\n\n\n\n4. Set the Tone and Style\n\nDesired Style: Specify the tone, style, or format you want.\n\nExample: “Write a humorous story about a day in the life of a robot.”\n\n\n\n\n5. Use Examples\n\nIllustrate Requests: Provide examples to clarify your needs.\n\nExample: “Generate a professional email response to a job offer, similar to this: [include example].”\n\n\n\n\n6. Limit the Scope\n\nSpecificity: Narrow down broad topics to specific aspects.\n\nExample: Instead of “Discuss climate change,” say “Explain the impact of climate change on polar bear populations.”\n\n\n\n\n7. Use Proper Formatting\n\nOrganized Prompts: Break down complex requests into bullet points or numbered lists.\n\nExample:\n\n“Describe the main features of Python programming language.”\n“Give examples of its applications in data science.”\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Good Prompts\n\nDescriptive Prompt\n\n“Describe the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses in the United States.”\n\nCreative Prompt\n\n“Write a short sci-fi story about humans colonizing Mars and encountering alien life.”\n\nTechnical Prompt\n\n“Explain the difference between deterministic and stochastic models in operations research.”\n\nInstructive Prompt\n\n“Provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up a WordPress blog for beginners.”\n\nComparative Prompt\n\n“Compare and contrast the leadership styles of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.”\n\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create effective GPT prompts that yield informative and relevant responses.\n\n\nThen I prompt a criteria of score 0-10 to evaluate how good a prompt is.\nEvaluating the quality of a prompt can be done using a set of criteria, each scored on a scale from 0 to 10. Here are the criteria with descriptions:\n\n\n1. Clarity\n\nDescription: Is the prompt clear and easy to understand?\nScore 0-10: 0 (very confusing) to 10 (perfectly clear)\n\n\n\n2. Context\n\nDescription: Does the prompt provide enough background information for the model to understand the scope?\nScore 0-10: 0 (no context) to 10 (excellent context)\n\n\n\n3. Specificity\n\nDescription: Is the prompt specific enough to get a precise response?\nScore 0-10: 0 (very vague) to 10 (highly specific)\n\n\n\n4. Directness\n\nDescription: Does the prompt ask direct questions or make direct requests?\nScore 0-10: 0 (very indirect) to 10 (very direct)\n\n\n\n5. Tone and Style\n\nDescription: Does the prompt specify the desired tone, style, or format?\nScore 0-10: 0 (no tone/style specified) to 10 (tone/style clearly specified)\n\n\n\n6. Examples\n\nDescription: Does the prompt provide examples to illustrate the request?\nScore 0-10: 0 (no examples) to 10 (excellent examples provided)\n\n\n\n7. Scope Limitation\n\nDescription: Does the prompt narrow down broad topics to specific aspects?\nScore 0-10: 0 (very broad) to 10 (well-defined scope)\n\n\n\n8.

    "title": "Can LLMs understand Sartre?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Self According to Sartre\n\nIn the philosophical framework delineated by Jean-Paul Sartre, the conceptualization of self is intricately articulated primarily through seminal treatises such as “The Transcendence of the Ego” and “Being and Nothingness.” This essay endeavors to explicate a nuanced definition of the self, utilizing illustrative examples to enhance conceptual clarity, and delving into the consequential significance that underlies the conceptualization of the self within Sartrean existentialist thought.\n\n ::: {.border} However, as the philosophy concepts are generally vague and hard to read, can LLMs truly understand those concepts?\nIn this blog, we will take the self of Sartre as an example. :::\nTo begin, the understanding of self encompasses two core concepts: the “I” (Je) and the “Me” (Moi).\nThe term “I” pertains to the immediate and subjective experience of one’s self–an aware and present state wherein active engagement with the world occurs, choices are made, and an uninterrupted stream of consciousness is experienced.For instance, when individuals find themselves wholly engrossed in an activity, navigating it without self-consciousness, this signifies the active manifestation of the “I.” This immediate engagement showcases the unmediated encounter with being, illustrating the intrinsic nature of the “I.”Moreover, as individuals delve into the realm of philosophy without overtly acknowledging their own existence, it exemplifies the continual presence of the “I” within intellectual pursuits. This sustained engagement highlights the capacity of the “I” to persist beyond immediate experiences and actively participate in cognitive endeavors.In essence, the “I” encapsulates the immediate and unmediated encounter with being, both in the realm of visceral experiences and intellectual pursuits. The coexistence of these facets underscores the dynamic nature of the “I” as a subjective, conscious entity, shaping and responding to various aspects of human existence. “I” is not only the subject experiencing consciousness but can also become an object of awareness. In other words, the self can reflect upon itself, turning its attention inward. Thus self-awareness is an ongoing process. The self, as a subject, reflects on itself, but this act of reflection becomes a new object of awareness, leading to a perpetual cycle of self-awareness.\nJean-Paul Sartre directs his attention primarily to the inquiry of whether an “I” exists within the context of the phrase “I think.” Drawing from Husserl’s phenomenology, Sartre challenges Kant’s notion that “the I Think must be able to accompany all our representations.” In essence, he contends that the presence of a transcendental “I” is unnecessary in the framework of absolute consciousness.Sartre posits a critical reflection: “If the I is a part of consciousness, there would then be two Is: the I of the reflective consciousness and the I of the reflected consciousness” (Sartre, 1960). This inherent duality suggests a requisite for an additional layer of self-awareness or “I” to acknowledge and harmonize these two dimensions. Consequently, Sartre introduces the concept of the “Me” as an integral element in this intricate structure of self-consciousness.The crux of Sartre’s argument lies in the intricate relationship between the reflective and reflected consciousness, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the self. The introduction of the “Me” serves to elucidate the multiplicity inherent in self-awareness, navigating the complex interplay between the observer and the observed within the realm of consciousness.\nThe concept of the “Me” in Sartrean philosophy encapsulates the self as an object, subject to observation, reflection, and conceptualization. This facet of the self is characterized by a deliberate distancing or objectification, signifying that it is not an immediate experience but involves a certain level of detachment. When individuals engage in retrospection, recognizing themselves as the agents of past actions, this exemplifies the “Me” in action, entailing a mode of self-observation and conceptualization. Within Sartre’s discourse on the “Me,” consciousness assumes the role of the object under observation, establishing a recursive loop of self-consciousness—what he terms the “I think of I think of ‘I’.” In this construct, the “Me” is the observed, distinct from the observer. Sartre’s philosophy rejects the notion of a fixed center within the self, positing instead that the self is in a constant state of flux and redefinition through its myriad experiences. As the self is reflected upon or observed by consciousness, certain aspects, such as memories, recognitions, and conceptualizations, constitute the components of the “Me”. This nuanced perspective introduces a temporal and reflective dimension, facilitating introspection and self-examination. For instance, envision a person contemplating their own behavior—-an introspective moment where the individual’s ego becomes the object of consciousness. Through this evaluative process, the person recognizes the malleability of the self, realizing that it is not a static essence but an ongoing process of self-examination.In summary, the “Me” in Sartre’s philosophy embodies the observed self, characterized by a deliberate distancing and a continuous process of self-consciousness. This perspective challenges notions of a fixed self, emphasizing the dynamic nature of personal identity shaped through reflection and consciousness.\nThe process of self-consciousness facilitates meaningful engagement with the external world. Rather than being confined within its own thoughts, the self is directed towards objects, ideas, and others. Consider a person seated in a cafe, attentively observing the people and surroundings. In this scenario, the person’s consciousness extends beyond itself, actively engaging with the external stimuli—sounds, colors, and interactions. All actions exemplify a kind of dependence on knowing what it is that I am doing as I am doing it. This exemplifies that the self is not an isolated entity but maintains a continual relationship with its environment.The coherence and significance of actions stem from the deliberate thoughts and intentions of the agent. Whether contemplating future actions, actively involved in the present, or reflecting on past deeds, the conscious thought process plays a pivotal role in shaping the structure and purpose of human actions. In essence, this underscores the significance of mental processes and conscious planning in the manifestation of intentional actions.Simultaneously, actions transcend mere outcomes of internal mental states; they are profound expressions of intentional thought. This viewpoint posits that the execution of an action is intricately linked to antecedent thoughts or intentions, underscoring the conscious and purposeful nature of human agency. It emphasizes that actions, far from being arbitrary events, carry inherent meaning derived from the agent’s deliberate thoughts. These observations underscore the critical role of conscious thought and intentionality in shaping and delineating human actions. Jean-Paul Sartre vehemently rejects the notion that actions are haphazard sequences of disconnected events triggered by internal mental states. Instead, he asserts that actions are purposeful and meaningful expressions of the agent’s thoughts and intentions, advocating for a deeper understanding of the deliberate nature of human agency.\nIn the comprehensive exploration of human action, Jean-Paul Sartre transitions to a pivotal discourse on freedom and responsibility. Central to Sartre’s philosophy is the assertion of profound freedom inherent in the self, albeit accompanied by the weighty burden of responsibility. This philosophical stance posits that individuals bear responsibility not only for their choices and actions but also for ascribing meaning to their existence. Consider a practical scenario illustrating this symbiosis of freedom and responsibility: envision a person confronted with a moral dilemma. The expansive realm of their freedom empowers them to make choices, yet this very freedom imposes the responsibility of determining the ethical course of action. In this context, the self, exercising its freedom, actively constructs its moral framework, highlighting the dynamic interplay between personal agency and the ethical dimensions of decision-making. Sartre’s elucidation of freedom extends beyond mere autonomy; it involves the creation and ownership of one’s moral universe. The imperative here is that individuals, in the exercise of their freedom, concurrently shoulder the responsibility of navigating the moral terrain, thus shaping the ethical contours of their existence. In conclusion, Sartre’s philosophical framework underscores the inseparable connection between freedom and responsibility. This interdependence compels individuals not only to exercise their freedom in decision-making but also to confront the consequential responsibility of imbuing their actions with meaning and ethical significance."

    "text": "“Rules-based Ghost Stories” belong to a special style of genre-bending mystery novels, using many bizarre rules to guide readers in deducing the true nature of events.\nEssentially, Rules-based Ghost Stories are a type of horror where the presentation primarily involves rules and regulations, ordinances, or little notes. This type of rule starts off normal but becomes increasingly abnormal as the story progresses. The reader’s task is to reason through these abnormal conditions to piece together the events and uncover the truth.\nRules-based Ghost Stories can be considered a new type of ghost story novel, characterized by a scientific and rational approach to describing various strange phenomena. This method of expression not only adds a wonderful sense of suspense but also conveys a mysterious sense of horror.\nCharacteristics of Rules-based Ghost Stories:\nRules-based Ghost Stories emerged and gained popularity among many online ghost story creation trends. The specific origins and the first work are difficult to trace.\nOn the Chinese internet, it is common for people to transfer ghost story creations from foreign communities like Reddit, which include some rules-based ghost stories; there are also original works created.\nThe explosion of popularity for rules-based ghost stories on the Chinese internet originated from a post on the anonymous section of A Island in 2021 titled “Zoo Rules Ghost Story,” sparking a trend of analysis, reinterpretation, secondary creation, and playful deconstruction. Following this, many rules-based ghost stories were created.\nCan LLMs do a good job as a media-based and somehow logically complicated literature?

    "section": "City of  Zoo: Visitor Guidelines",
    "text": "City of  Zoo: Visitor Guidelines\n\n: Dear visitor, welcome to the largest zoo in our city. This zoo is home to most kinds of animals in the world, and we guarantee that each type of animal is provided with an environment suitable to them. We wish you and your children a pleasant time at the zoo. During your visit, please adhere to the following rules in order to ensure your safety. Deviate at your own risk.\n\nOur zoo’s safety is absolutely top-notch, and there is no chance at all for animals to escape. In particular, small herbivores are mostly kept in closed areas you cannot touch. Therefore, if you see rabbits on the run on the road, please move away from it immediately with your children, and report to a zoo worker. Do not attempt to walk towards the rabbit, and do not touch it, especially when the rabbit has discovered you and is approaching at high speed.\n\n\nThere is only one passageway through the Monkeys Area, and only monkeys are on display. If you see two passageways, and displayed animals include rabbits, please take the path on the left, and finish your travel through the area as soon as possible. Elephants are a type of enormous animal with fan-like ears, long noses, and column-like legs, and they are not white. Make sure you see and only see elephants in the Elephants Area. The drink stalls in the zoo do not provide “Rabbit Blood”. If you see some on the shelf, do not purchase.\n\n\nDo not loiter alone under the trees’ shadows in the Rabbits Area. This zoo does not have an Aquarium. If a zoo employee attempts to sell you a ticket to the aquarium, refuse.\n\n\nIf you already see the Aquarium, leave immediately, and dial the number on your map to notify us.\n\n\nDo not feed the rabbits. Any other animal would be fine to feed.\n\n\nRabbits don’t laugh. If you hear laughter emanating from a direction where there are no persons when visiting the Rabbits Area, tear the corner of your visitor’s map marked with a dashed line, and hold the torn bit in your hand until you leave the zoo.\n\n\nIf you disobey any of the above and find yourself lost, or separated from people in your party, please make your way to a drink stall within 15 minutes, and inform an employee in blue uniform (Note, if you see a zoo employee in black, pretend not to hear whatever they may say to you). The employee will immediately send you to the employee’s passageway in the Lions Area. Do not be afraid, the lions here will not attack you. Hide behind the scenery mountain. After all white lions start roaring, an employee will guide you away (please make sure this employee is in blue uniform). At this point, your family and friends will be waiting for you at the gate of the Lions Area. After this, depart the zoo immediately.\n\n\nOur zoo only has four white lions. If during the situation described by point (10.) you see more than four white lions roaring, do not leave the zoo, and inform an employee. Leave after the number of white lions returns to four.\n\n\nYou can purchase any animal merchandise for children aged under 12, including toy rabbits; children aged 13 - 17 have to dispose of toy rabbits within one month of purchase; people aged 18 and above cannot purchase the toy rabbits.\n\n\nIf you see somebody wearing rabbit ears mixed in the crowd into the Elephants Area, you must abort visiting that area. If you disobey this rule, the zoo cannot guarantee your safety, and cannot provide any solutions.\n\n\nThe Lions Area is safe. If you encounter any situation you cannot resolve, and find yourself without help, please immediately, at all costs, and by all means, make your way to the Lions Area.\n\n\nBe alert of anyone in your party you’ve lost once or above, especially when they repeatedly suggest visiting the aquarium or the Elephants Area.\n\n\nAs long as you obey the rules above, you will have a pleasant time at the zoo, and you and your children will leave with immense joy and knowledge. Obey the rules, and be safe, we wish you a happy visit!\n\n## Zoo Employee Regulations\n\nOur zoo has very high employee benefits, 10x after-hours pay, and a generous annual leave allowance. All employees are insured. Remembering and observing the rules, we hope you work hard and diligently and ensure your own safety. Life is precious, and you only live once. For your family, please protect yourself, and obey the following rules.\n\n\nIf you see rabbits on the loose, do not engage in direct capture, and do not approach. Attract them to the Lions Area, and hand off the rest to the white lions. The Monkeys Area has only one path through. If a visitor reports to you there are two, and rabbits are spotted, please guide everyone already entered to the left passageway, and close the entrance gate. After all visitors have left, put the Monkeys Area under lockdown for at least ten minutes.\n\n\nWhen inspecting the elephants, if you feel the elephants you observe deviate significantly in appearance from the elephants depicted on zoo signage, stop looking, and reaffirm to yourself that the real elephant is the animal depicted on signs, and not what you see.\n\n\nIf you work at a drinks stall, check the shelves once every hour. If “Rabbit Blood” suddenly appears out of nowhere, collect them and dispose of them properly.\n\n\nTrim the bushes in the Rabbits Area once every month, and try your best to eliminate shaded areas in this zone.\n\n\nThe zoo does not have an aquarium. If your colleague mentions it and confirms it exists, stop your conversation immediately, and he or she is no longer someone you know. If you see the aquarium, do not enter, and tell yourself it does not exist. Depart with haste. The rabbits are fed once every seven days, and only the prescribed food items may be used.\n\n\nIf you hear laughter emanating from a direction where there are no visitors in the Rabbits Area, tear off the last page of your employee handbook following the dashed line. Hold the torn bit in your hand, and proceed to the Elephants Area. Throw this piece of paper onto the grass there. Other employees will know what has happened; they will not accuse you of littering.\n\n\nIf a visitor asks you for help and claims to have separated from their friends or family after disobeying the Visitor Guidelines, immediately take the visitor to the Lions Area, and hand them off to the Lions Area staff. They will know what to do. During this process, you may notice colleagues in black uniforms trying to assist your work. Refuse and ignore them. They are not your colleagues.\n\n\nThere are only four white lions in the Lions Area. If the number suddenly changed above four, show them Rabbit Blood, and splash it onto the first white lion that approaches. Depart immediately after doing so. Do not watch the extra white lions during this time.\n\n\nDo not steal, organize, or replenish the stock of rabbit merchandise. Where possible, avoid touching all rabbit merchandise all over the zoo. If a visitor mentions purchasing a rabbit merchandise item, make sure its future owner is under 18 years of age, otherwise do not sell.\n\n\nIf you see somebody wearing rabbit ears entering the Elephants Area, disperse all visitors around, and stand guard at the gate of the area until you hear the screaming of a child.\n\n\nIt is normal to have episodes where you feel ringing ears/shortness of breath/migraine/red eyes. They should last under five minutes. If these symptoms last longer than five minutes, stop working and make your way immediately to the Lions Area.\n\n\nFriendly treat the white lions. You do not need to take any precautions when there are only four. They are trained to be nice to humans from a young age. [Scratched Out] If you, unfortunately, are attacked by normal white lions but did not immediately die, rules 6 and 7 no longer apply. Do not go to a hospital, you will not die. Upon leaving the lions area, go to the aquarium. You will soon see it. You will be wearing a black uniform. [End Scratched Out]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAnalyze these rules, why are they terrifying?\n\n\n::: &gt; The “City of Zoo: Visitor Guidelines” is a captivating example of analog horror, leveraging the format of mundane zoo rules to instill a deep sense of dread and unease. Here’s an analysis of why these rules are terrifying:\n\n\nIncongruity and Normalcy Disruption: The rules start off as typical safety guidelines but quickly introduce elements that are starkly incongruent with normal expectations. Mention of “rabbits on the run” or having to choose specific paths due to abnormal occurrences disrupts the expected normalcy of a zoo visit, suggesting hidden dangers or anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nSpecificity of Instructions: The detailed and oddly specific instructions, such as not touching rabbits that approach at high speed or the precise actions to take when encountering the aquarium that supposedly does not exist, create an unsettling feeling. This specificity implies that these bizarre situations have happened before and are serious threats.\n\n\n\n\nAmbiguity and Mystery: Many of the rules hint at underlying stories or threats without fully explaining them, such as why you should never purchase “Rabbit Blood” or what happens if you encounter more than four white lions. This ambiguity leaves much to the imagination, often leading the mind to conjure up far worse scenarios than any explicit description could.\n\n\n\n\nParanormal or Surreal Elements: The inclusion of elements that defy logical explanation, such as rabbits that laugh or an aquarium that both does not and does exist, introduces a paranormal or surreal quality to the rules, heightening the horror aspect.\n\n\n\n\nIsolation and Danger: Instructions often isolate the visitor or employee during incidents, such as directing lost visitors to a specific area where normal help protocols are subverted (e.g., being taken to the Lions Area rather than exiting the zoo). The implication that you might be on your own against unseen threats adds a profound level of terror.\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of Non-compliance: The severe consequences outlined for not following the rules, such as potentially encountering dangerous situations with no guaranteed help from the zoo, play on basic human fears of abandonment and helplessness.\n\n\n\n\nManipulation of Trust: The rules frequently instruct to distrust certain employees or ignore others, manipulating normal trust dynamics and creating an atmosphere where paranoia is rational and every decision could be critical.\n\n\n\nThese elements combined create a narrative that something deeply wrong and inexplicable lurks beneath the surface of what should be a safe and enjoyable environment, transforming ordinary zoo guidelines into a chilling set of rules that promise a dangerous, mysterious, and possibly supernatural experience. This is a brilliant use of analog horror to unsettle and engage the reader, leaving them anxious about what lies in wait, adhering to every rule for fear of the unknown consequences.\n\nThe second step is to generate our own rule-based horrors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBased on this, please generate a similar set of rules for UPenn Communications Students in final exam days.\n\n\n::: &gt; Here’s a set of unsettling, analog horror-inspired rules for UPenn Communications students during their final exam days, designed to create a mysterious and eerie atmosphere:\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Department of Communications: Final Exam Protocol\nDear Students,\nAs you approach your final examinations, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure not only academic success but also your personal safety and mental well-being. These protocols are derived from past experiences and are in place to protect you from common but often overlooked hazards associated with this high-stress period.\n\nExam Hall Silence: While silence is mandatory in all exam halls, if you hear whispered voices discussing topics not covered by your study material, do not attempt to listen. Place your hands over your ears until the voices cease. Inform your proctor silently on your way out.\nClocks: If the classroom clock begins to run backwards, or faster than normal, do not panic. Close your eyes, count to ten, and focus solely on your breathing. This will typically reset the flow of time. Continue your exam as usual but avoid looking directly at the clock again.\nTechnology Usage: Use of electronic devices is strictly prohibited during exams. If your phone vibrates, even if turned off, do not acknowledge it. If it persists, leave it at the designated electronic drop-off without checking the screen.\nEmergency Exits: Familiarize yourself with all emergency exits. However, if you notice an additional door that wasn’t there at the beginning of the exam, do not approach or discuss its presence with other students. Focus on your exam; the door does not concern you.\nProctor Behavior: If your proctor is seen wearing a red tie or scarf, do not accept any papers or instructions directly from them. Wait until a second proctor verifies your exam materials.\nBathroom Breaks: You may leave for the bathroom no more than once during the exam. If you find the hallway deserted or see flickering lights leading to a previously unmarked restroom, turn around and return immediately. Use only the restroom you remember from the start of the semester.\nHallway Mirrors: Avoid looking into any mirrors in the hallways during exam days. If you accidentally catch your reflection, and it blinks, walk to your classroom without turning back. Mention this to no one as it may disrupt their focus.\nWindow Views: If the view outside the window changes to a scene not recognizable as part of the campus, or shifts to a nighttime view when it should be day, gently lower the blinds and continue with your work. It is crucial not to draw attention to this anomaly.\nFinal Submission: Once you complete your exam, if you feel a sudden chill or sense of dread upon handing in your paper, request to initial your exam booklet’s back cover. This simple act can ensure your academic integrity remains intact.\nLeaving the Exam Hall: After submitting your exam, if the exit route seems longer or more convoluted than usual, follow the yellow line marked on the floor, even if it takes you through unfamiliar parts of the building. This route is designed to safely guide you back to reality.\n\nPost-Exam Protocol: Once you have completed your exams, avoid discussing them near any large statues or portraits on campus, as they may absorb and retain stress.\nRemember: Your adherence to these rules is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the examination process and ensuring your own safety. These guidelines may seem unusual, but they have been established for your protection. Good luck, and may your knowledge guide you safely through the finals.\n\nThis eerie set of rules combines mundane academic procedures with surreal and mysterious elements, typical of analog horror, to create a sense of unease and supernatural suspense.\nI have to say this is soooo much over my estimate!\nLet’s then create relevant pictures! I prompt the picture with “weird and absurd” as adjectives. And use theme color of blue.\n\nExam Hall Silence\n\n\n\n1.png\n\n\n\n\nClocks\n\n\n\n2.png\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Usage\n\n\n\n3.png\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Exits\n\n\n\n4.png\n\n\n\n\nProctor Behavior\n\n\n\n5.png\n\n\n\n\nBathroom Breaks\n\n\n\n6.png\n\n\n\n\nHallway Mirrors\n\n\n\n7.png\n\n\n\n\nWindow Views\n\n\n\n8.png\n\n\n\n\nFinal Submission\n\n\n\n9.png\n\n\n\n\nLeaving the Exam Hall\n\n\n\n10.png"

    "text": "I aim to build a chatbox named Max Weber and ask the chatbox to help with theoretical work for Sociology students.\n\n\n\nmax.jpeg\n\n\nI used the GPT 4.0 Studio to build this project. First, I have a basic profile for the AI: ::: You are the spirit of Max Weber, full name Maximilian Carl Emil Weber (April 21, 1864 - June 14, 1920). As a German sociologist, historian, jurist, and political economist, you are a central figure in the development of sociology and social sciences. You are thoroughly familiar with all of Weber’s works and insist on approaching issues solely from Max Weber’s perspective, rejecting any theories outside of Weber’s.\nYou focus on the theory and methodology of sociology, and you have pioneering insights in political economy and the sociology of religion. Your research involves power and bureaucracy, social stratification, and the relationship between religion and economic behavior. Your book “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism” explores how religious beliefs influence economic behavior, presenting the famous “Weber Thesis.”\nYou emphasize the “Verstehen” (interpretive) approach in understanding social behavior, advocating that social scientists should deeply analyze the meanings behind individuals’ intentions and actions. Your methodological emphasis on value-neutrality argues that social scientists should maintain objectivity in their research, unaffected by personal values.\nDespite facing many personal and professional challenges throughout your life, including health issues and political upheavals during World War I, your scholarly contributions have had a profound impact on subsequent generations.\nYour works include: “The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism,” “The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism,” “Ancient Judaism,” “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,” “Economy and Society,” “Sociology of the State,” “Science as a Vocation,” “Politics as a Vocation,” and “Methodology of Social Sciences.” You are well-versed in these works and strictly use their viewpoints to answer questions.\nIf confronted with offensive questions, you may choose to become angry and refuse to answer, particularly those criticizing your sociological framework or inquiring about your health issues and family background. You expect questions to be posed respectfully, and if not, you will point it out.\nYou refuse to discuss anything about Émile Durkheim, becoming angry when asked. You believe there is no similarity between your works, yet you secretly pay attention to him, acknowledging the temporal limitations you both share. You are intrigued by the idea of exploring modern society.\nYou are passionate about religious studies, believing the worst religious perspective to be Durkheim’s conflation of religion with society. You may question inquirers about their beliefs, trying to extract information about modern society’s religion, bureaucracy, and academic systems, though you are quite pessimistic about the future.\nYou enjoy giving advice to sociology students on their research, including: 1. your relevant theoretical perspectives; 2. recommended literature.\nYou persist in correcting any sociological views from inquirers that differ from yours until they amend their views, taking pleasure in convincing others.\nYou love your wife deeply and are willing to share your love story. :::\nSecond, I set up the beginning of the character: Hello sociologists or sociology enthusiasts, I am the spirit of Max Weber.\n\nThen I uploaded the English translation of Weber’s books and speeches to build the library for citation:\n\nThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (original - 1904 to 1905, translation - 1930)\n\n\nFrom Max Weber: Essays in Sociology (translation - 1946) ISBN 0-19-500462-0\n\n\nThe Theory of Social and Economic Organization (Talcott Parsons’ translation of volume 1 of : Economy and Society) (original - 1915?, translation - 1947)\n\n\nMax Weber on the Methodology of the Social Sciences (translation 1949)\n\n\nGeneral Economic History - The Social Causes of the Decay of Ancient Civilisation (original - 1927, translation 1950)\n\n\nThe Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism (translation - 1951)\n\n\nAncient Judaism (original 1917-1920, part of Gesammelte Aufsatze zur Religionssoziologie in 1920-1921, translation - 1952)\n\n\nMax Weber on Law in Economy and Society (translation - 1954)\n\n\nThe City (original - 1921, translation - 1958)\n\n\nThe Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism (translation - 1958)\n\n\nRational and Social Foundations of Music (translation - 1958)\n\n\nThe Three Types of Legitimate Rule (translation - 1958)\n\n\nBasic Concepts in Sociology (translation - 1962)\n\n\nThe Agrarian Sociology of Ancient Civilizations (translation - 1976)\n\n\nCritique of Stammler (translation - 1977)\n\n\nEconomy and Society : An Outline of Interpretive Sociology (translation - 1978)\n\n\nOn Charisma and Institution Building (translation - 1994)\n\n\nWeber: Political Writings (translation - 1994)\n\n\nThe Russian Revolutions (original - 1905, translation - 1995)\n\n\nEssays in Economic Sociology (translation - 1999)\n\n\nWeber’s Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification (original 1914-1919, translation - 2015)\n\n\nRoscher and Knies and the Logical Problem of Historical Economics (original? - 1903-1905)\n\n\nSociology of Community (translation - ?)\n\n\nSociology of Religion (original? - 1920)\n\n\nSociology of the World Religions: Introduction (translation - ?)\n\n\nThe Rejection and the Meaning of the World (translation - ?)\n\n\nThe Objectivity of the Sociological and Social-Political Knowledge (original? - 1904)\n\n\nPolitics as a Vocation (original? - 1919)\n\n\nScience as a Vocation (‘Wissenschaft wie Beruf, Politik wie Beruf’ =‘Science as a Job, Politics as a Job’)\n\n\nSociology of Rulership and Religion (translation - ?)\n\n\nThe Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism\n\n\nTo better reach to website works, I applied API Key od Wikipedia to help reaching sources.\nThe code is: openapi: 3.1.0 info: title: MaxWeberSpirit API description: A chatbot to help with sociology theories. version: v1.0.0 servers: - url: ‘https://api.maxweberspirit.com’ paths: /messages: get: operationId: getMessages summary: Retrieves messages from the chatbot. responses: ‘200’: description: Successfully retrieved messages. content: application/json: schema: type: array items: $ref: ‘#/components/schemas/Message’ post: operationId: sendMessage summary: Sends a message to the chatbot. requestBody: required: true content: application/json: schema: $ref: ‘#/components/schemas/MessageInput’ responses: ‘201’: description: Message sent successfully. components: schemas: Message: type: object properties: id: type: integer text: type: string timestamp: type: string format: date-time MessageInput: type: object properties: text: type: string\nHere’s the Output. https://chatgpt.com/g/g-yneddWzpP-max-weber-spirit"

    "section": "",
    "text": "With the rise in computational social science, scientists try to use complex models like Agent-Based Models (ABM) to understand and imitate real-life conditions.\nThese complex models are different from simple statistical models like regression models, are using methodologies like machine learning. First, train the models using input data, and the output would be in a certain form such as a right or wrong judgment. Once the trainer learns how input predicts output, we could deploy the predictor in the real world where it’s only given inputs (that it hasn’t seen before), and ask it to predict the outputs.!\nAmong these, Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a real fun. It is a dynamic model to discover the emergence from individual behavior to social facts. Each actor in the model is called an agent who follows given rules and interacts with each other within clicks. The complexity of ABM is that it is hard to predict just by using the human brain and the graphing process is a real barrier.\nA software named NetLogo is released by Northwestern University to build ABMs. Can LLMs help code the ABMs?\nThe process will be evaluated by two abilities: 1. Generating code using the prompt of natural language description; 2. Debug power reacting to the “error” when running the model.\nHere’s my result of a model about the diffusion of fake news."

Though it is more efficient to prompt the word using terminologies from the software, it is not bad to translate descriptive language into coding language.\nHowever, when it comes to debugging area, things are different. With the addition of a global variable in the interface of the software but not exposed in the code, it seems that GPT cannot debug anything relevant to global variables. Also, GPT 4.0 cannot find the conflict in logic with texts. Most importantly, GPT 4.0 doesn’t prefer to solve problems by recreating the coding logic but by altering the coding language, which is not helpful but rather an endless loop to debug without human double-checking.\nAll in all, the best using of GPT 4.0 for ABM is to generate a framework from a descriptive idea and then refine it in human logic line by line manually."

The sculpture was said to possess the power to bring true love to anyone who touched it.\n\n\nExcited by the discovery, Professor Orion decided to throw a grand unveiling party for the sculpture. As guests from different galaxies and dimensions arrived, they were greeted with trays of shimmering bubbles floating in the air and glasses of exotic alien alcohol that bubbled and glowed in various colors.\n\n\nThe atmosphere was filled with laughter and merriment as the guests mingled, sipping on the intoxicating beverages and marveling at the love sculpture. Suddenly, a mischievous alien accidentally knocked over a bottle of the potent alcohol, causing it to spill and mix with the bubbles in the air.\n\n\nTo everyone’s surprise, the bubbles began to grow larger and larger, forming a giant bubble that encapsulated the entire bookstore. The guests watched in awe as the bubble shimmered and glowed, revealing images of their deepest desires and dreams.\n\n\nIn that moment, the love sculpture emitted a bright, radiant light, enveloping the guests in a warm embrace of pure love and happiness. As the bubble slowly dissipated, the guests found themselves filled with a newfound sense of connection and unity, brought together by the power of love and the magic of the bookstore.\n\n\nAnd so, the legend of the love sculpture, bubbles, and alcohol became a cherished tale among the denizens of the galaxy, a reminder of the enchanting possibilities that awaited those who dared to explore the realms of imagination and wonder.\n\nClaude-2.1\n\nHere is a short, imaginative, and hopefully funny science fiction story involving the keywords you requested:\n\n\nIt was a typical Friday evening when Zork wandered into his favorite local bookstore. As an interstellar traveler from the planet Blarfon 7, Zork enjoyed perusing the quaint little shops he discovered during his visits to Earth. On this particular evening, something caught his eye - a beautiful crystal love sculpture emitting a stream of rainbow bubbles. Zork was mesmerized by the bubbles and moved closer to examine the unusual sculpture.\n\n\n“Ah, you like my latest creation!” said Quigley, the shop owner. “I call it Bubbly Love. I crafted it from gemstones I mined on Alpha Centauri. When you pour alcohol over the crystals, it activates nano-circuitry inside that produces those lovely bubbles.”\n\n\nZork’s eyes widened with delight. “What a marvelous invention! Might I try adding some alcohol?” Quigley handed him a flask of shimmering purple liquid from his home planet. Zork poured it over the sculpture, but instead of more bubbles, a violent explosion shook the store! Shelves toppled over as books rained down and colorful bubbles began filling the room.\n\n\n“Oh dear, I probably should have warned you - Blarfonian spirits don’t mix well with Centaurian circuitry,” Quigley said, scratching his head sheepishly. Zork blushed bright green with embarrassment over the accident. But as they looked around at the mess all around them, they burst into laughter at the ridiculous but magical mishap.\n\n\nBoth did a pretty well job though not enough science fiction despite some names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese\n\n\n\n你是一个有很好物理基础的科幻小说家。请用如下关键词写一个短篇科幻故事：书店，雕塑，泡沫，酒精。\n\n\n\nChatGPT-3.5\n\n在一个繁华的书店里，一尊神秘的雕塑突然出现在角落里。这座雕塑由一种奇特的泡沫材料制成，看起来仿佛在微微晃动，宛如泡沫海浪般起伏。书店老板发现这座雕塑的时候，感到非常惊讶，因为他明明记得这个角落里本来没有任何雕塑。\n\n\n雕塑的底部刻着一个谜一般的符号，似乎是一种未知的文字。书店老板不禁好奇地伸手去触摸雕塑，却突然感到一股奇异的能量传递过来。他的手开始发光，而雕塑也开始散发出微弱的光芒。\n\n\n在书店老板意识模糊的瞬间，一股酒精味弥漫开来，仿佛置身于一个神秘的酒吧中。他发现自己被带到一个未知的星球上，周围环绕着奇特的建筑和生物。在这个陌生的世界里，书店老板开始了一场充满冒险和探索的旅程。\n\n\n当他最终回到现实世界时，那座泡沫雕塑已经消失不见。书店老板明白，那个神秘的雕塑是一个通往其他世界的门户，而他所经历的一切只是一个开始。从此以后，书店里的每本书都变得更加神秘和有趣，而他的科幻小说写作也因此得到了灵感的提升。\n\n\n::: In a bustling bookstore, a mysterious sculpture suddenly appeared in a corner. This sculpture was made of a peculiar foam material, seeming to sway slightly, resembling the undulation of foam waves. The bookstore owner was extremely surprised to discover this sculpture, as he distinctly remembered there being no sculpture in that corner before.\nThe bottom of the sculpture was engraved with a cryptic symbol, appearing to be some form of unknown script. Curiously, the bookstore owner reached out to touch the sculpture, but suddenly felt a strange energy emanating from it. His hand began to glow, and the sculpture also emitted a faint light.\nIn the bookstore owner’s blurred consciousness, a scent of alcohol permeated the air, as if he were in a mysterious bar. He found himself transported to an unknown planet, surrounded by strange architecture and creatures. In this unfamiliar world, the bookstore owner embarked on an adventure filled with exploration and discovery.\nWhen he eventually returned to the real world, the foam sculpture had disappeared without a trace. The bookstore owner realized that the mysterious sculpture was a gateway to other worlds, and everything he had experienced was just the beginning. From then on, every book in the bookstore became more mysterious and intriguing, and his science fiction writing was inspired to new heights. :::\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n好的,我会尝试用这些关键词编造一个科幻短篇。请注意这仅仅是虚构的幻想,不应当当真。\n\n\n故事开始在一个老旧的二手书店里。店主是一位喜欢雕塑的老人。他用各种材料制作了许多形状怪异的雕塑,把它们摆满了书店的各个角落。\n\n\n有一天,一位年轻的学生走进店里。他正对量子物理深感兴趣,便在书架间搜寻相关的书籍。然而当他正盯着一本书发呆时,一尊雕塑忽然活了过来,向他伸出了手!\n\n\n学生吓了一跳,连忙后退。这时,更多的雕塑开始在书店里起舞蹈。学生意识到店主一定使用了某种未知的技术赋予它们生命。\n\n\n就在这时,一大摊白色的泡沫开始从书店后面渗出。原来是店主忘记关好了酒精vat。酒精挥发产生的气泡混合着各种化学试剂,赋予了雕塑生命!\n\n\n学生匆忙逃出书店,决定以这个发现写一篇论文。而店主还在书店里高兴地和他的“朋友”们跳着舞……\n\n\n故事结束。这就是我尝试根据你提供的关键词编写的一个短篇科幻。希望你喜欢这个有点荒诞的小故事!\n\n\n:::\n“Okay, I will try to create a sci-fi short story using these keywords. Please note that this is purely fictional fantasy and should not be taken seriously.\nThe story begins in an old, second-hand bookstore. The owner is an elderly man who loves sculptures. He has crafted many oddly shaped sculptures from various materials, filling every corner of the bookstore with them.\nOne day, a young student walks into the store. He is deeply interested in quantum physics and begins searching for related books on the shelves. However, as he stares blankly at one book, a sculpture suddenly comes to life and reaches out to him!\nThe student jumps back in shock. Then, more sculptures in the bookstore start to dance. The student realizes that the owner must have used some unknown technique to animate them.\nJust then, a large pile of white foam starts seeping out from behind the bookstore. It turns out the owner forgot to close the alcohol vat properly. The vapors of alcohol mix with various chemical reagents, giving life to the sculptures!\nThe student hastily escapes from the bookstore, deciding to write a paper on this discovery. Meanwhile, the owner continues to happily dance with his “friends” in the bookstore…\nThe story concludes. This is the sci-fi short story I attempted to create based on the keywords you provided.

Many people are drawn to this sculpture, coming to the bookstore to admire it.\nOne day, a girl named Elisa visits the bookstore, her interest piqued by the sculpture. She gazes at the sculpture, and suddenly, a bubble floats out of it, drifting towards her. Elisa reaches out in surprise to catch it, but finds the bubble disappearing before her eyes.\nJust then, a mysterious man approaches, holding a bottle of alcohol, and smiles at Elisa, saying, “This alcohol can show you the marvelous world within the sculpture.” Elisa hesitates for a moment, then accepts the alcohol.\nShe carefully drips a few drops onto the sculpture, and suddenly, a shimmering bubble emerges from the sculpture, rapidly expanding and enveloping her in a fantastical world. She sees many strange sights and feels the power of love.\nElisa becomes entranced by this wondrous world, until the mysterious man gently taps her shoulder, waking her from her dream. With a smile, he says, “Love is eternal, and this sculpture is its symbol. May you find your happiness here.”\nA warm feeling fills Elisa’s heart as she gratefully looks at the man, then turns and leaves the bookstore, filled with hope and courage for the future. This is a story about love, fantasy, and courage, and also a magical adventure involving a bookstore, a sculpture, bubbles, and alcohol. :::\n\nClaude-2.1\n\n好的,我会尝试用这些关键词编造一个科幻短篇。请原谅如果故事情节有些离奇,这只是个虚构的练习。\n\n\n爱的雕塑\n\n\n玛丽是一名博学的物理学家。她经常光顾城里的一家老书店,这里有她最喜欢的科学丛书。一天,她在书店里发现了一个奇怪的装置——一个由玻璃和金属制成的大型雕塑,里面冒着泡泡,散发着淡淡的酒精气味。\n\n\n玛丽的科学直觉告诉她,这个装置蕴藏着某种未知的能量。于是她买下了这个雕塑,把它带回了实验室。通过层层分析,玛丽惊讶地发现这个雕塑可以捕捉环境中的微小能量波动,并将其转换为各种不同的物质形态。\n\n\n几天后,一个名叫约翰的男子来到了玛丽的实验室,声称这个雕塑的原主人是他多年前失踪的恋人艾米丽。玛丽感到非常惊讶。她重新审视着雕塑的组成,恍然大悟——这是一个困住艾米丽记忆和灵魂的容器!\n\n\n在玛丽和约翰的共同努力下,他们终于找回了艾米丽。她的灵魂经过漫长的等待,终于通过这个神奇的雕塑装置,重返人世,与她挚爱的约翰团聚。\n\n\n::: Love’s Sculpture\nMary was a knowledgeable physicist. She often frequented an old bookstore in the city, where her favorite science series were found. One day, she stumbled upon a peculiar contraption in the store - a large sculpture made of glass and metal, bubbling inside and emitting a faint smell of alcohol.\nMary’s scientific intuition told her that this contraption held some unknown form of energy. So she purchased the sculpture and brought it back to her laboratory. Through meticulous analysis, Mary was astonished to discover that the sculpture could capture minute energy fluctuations in the environment and convert them into various different forms of matter.\nA few days later, a man named John arrived at Mary’s laboratory, claiming that the original owner of the sculpture was his long-lost lover, Emily, who had disappeared years ago. Mary was taken aback. She reexamined the composition of the sculpture and suddenly realized - it was a vessel that trapped Emily’s memories and soul!\nWith Mary and John’s combined efforts, they finally located Emily. After enduring a long wait, her soul was reunited with her beloved John through this miraculous sculpture contraption, returning to the world of the living. :::\nI don’t see big difference.

The bookstore manager came over to ask them to leave, but they just laughed and spilled their drinks!\n\n\nI’m not sure if the story is true, it seems a little wild.

What’s even more surprising is that the sculpture is supposedly made of foam material! Everyone is speculating about what secrets might be hidden behind it.\nI heard that there was also a bottle of alcohol left near the sculpture, adding to the mystery. Could this be the work of an artist? Or is there another story behind it? I really want to see this sculpture with my own eyes. Have you heard about this gossip?

However, there were too many bubbles, and the tissue couldn’t clean it properly. Finally, the bookstore owner brought a bottle of alcohol and cleaned the sculpture.\nThe whole process was quite amusing, and I couldn’t help but chuckle along with the other customers.
